- **NEKOPARA Vol. 3**
- **NEKOPARA Vol. 4**

---

‚ö†Ô∏è **Special Notice:**

> **NEKOPARA Vol. 0 & NEKOPARA Extra are not supported for patch installation ‚ùó**

> **Patches will not be installed for games you do not own ‚ùó**

> **This tool is only for patch installation and does not install games ‚ùó It is limited to Windows systems ‚ùó**

> **The tool requires administrator privileges to run ‚ùó
> Reason: To prevent users from running the game while using this tool, which can affect the installation process, the tool checks and closes any running game processes before proceeding ‚ùó**

---

## üîÑ Usage Instructions/Process:

1. Download "FRAISEMOE Addons Installer.exe" from the repository.
2. **Close any running instances of the [supported games](#supported-games).**
3. If prompted to run as an administrator, grant administrative privileges. **If administrative privileges cannot be obtained, the application will not run and will exit automatically.**
4. If prompted to close any running games, select "Yes". **If the running games cannot be closed, the application will not run and will exit automatically.**
5. After entering the application, choose "Start Install", and select **the parent directory of the game directory**.

   > **Important Note 1** ‚ùì What is the "parent directory of the game directory"? How do I obtain it?
   > For Steam platform, find the "Library" option at the top, then locate the [supported games list](#supported-games) in the left game list; right-click on the game, choose "Manage" -> "Browse Local Files" to get the game directory. In the address bar, click the "‚Üê" button in the File Explorer. If you see the game folder (e.g., "NEKOPARA Vol. 1") in the File Explorer, the current directory is the parent directory of the game directory; copy the path from the address bar.

   > **Important Note 2** ‚ùì How do I use this tool for third-party installed games?
   > For third-party installations with non-fixed paths, manually copy the parent directory of the game directory, similar to the method used for Steam-installed games.

   > Example (for reference only, do not copy directly):
   > Game folder: C:\ (drive letter may vary)\Steam\steamapps\common\NEKOPARA Vol. 1
   > Parent directory of the game folder: C:\ (drive letter may vary)\Steam\steamapps\common

6. In the directory selection page, paste the copied path into the **address bar** of the File Explorer and click "Select Folder". **(Ensure that the text in the lower folder selection box matches the last folder name in the path; if not, reselect the folder).**

   > ‚àö Correct example (for reference only, do not copy directly):
   > Path entered in the address bar: C:\ (drive letter may vary)\Steam\steamapps\common
   > Folder name below: common

7. After selecting the folder, you may encounter the following situations:
<table>
    <tr>
        <td><h5>Status</h5></td>
        <td><h5>Action</h5></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Game exists but patch is not installed</td>
        <td>Proceed with the download task</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Game exists,<br />but patch has been installed from another source or patch files are corrupted</td>
        <td>Ask whether to reinstall the patch using this tool. If the patch from another source is usable, you can choose not to reinstall.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Game does not exist</td>
        <td>Skip the patch installation step</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Game exists,<br />but the corresponding version patch cannot be installed using this tool</td>
        <td>Repeat the installation steps</td>
    </tr>
</table>

8. Confirm the final installation result, then choose "Exit".

## üî∞ Software Features:

- Detects the patch status of the [supported games](#supported-games) and compares the [Hash(SHA-256)](#hashsha-256-checksum) to determine if the patch file is intact. If the patch file from another source is damaged, it asks whether to reinstall the patch, deletes the old patch file, downloads the patch package, and reinstalls it.
- Detects all uninstalled versions and executes the installation tasks.
